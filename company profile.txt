Topographic Survey:
At Royal Survey, our Topographic Survey services offer comprehensive and detailed mapping of land features essential for accurate site planning and engineering design. We capture and represent physical features of the terrain, including:
•	Spot Elevations
•	Contours
•	Natural and Man-made Landmarks
These surveys are crucial in understanding surface conditions, slopes, drainage patterns, and landform variations, Depending on site-specific conditions; we utilize advanced equipment such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Total Stations to ensure the highest level of accuracy and data quality. Our experienced field teams and CAD specialists work together to produce clear, precise topographic maps tailored to each project's unique requirements.




Underground Utilities Detection Survey:
Our Underground Utility Detection Survey services are designed to accurately identify and map subsurface utility infrastructure, enabling safer and more efficient project planning. This type of survey provides critical information about the type and location of underground utilities, allowing clients to create a comprehensive utility map that supports informed decision-making throughout all project phases. Our underground utility surveys help to:
•	Reduce project planning time
•	Minimize costly design changes
•	Prevent construction delays and hazards
•	Enhance on-site safety in compliance with health and safety regulations

	Key utilities that can be detected include:
•	Metallic fuel pipes
•	Electrical cables
•	Metallic gas pipelines



Demarcation Survey:
Plot Demarcation Survey services are carried out to accurately establish and mark the legal boundaries of a plot or land parcel. This process is essential for confirming land ownership, resolving boundary disputes, and preparing for construction or development. Typically, coordinates provided in official land records or title deeds define the plot boundaries. During the demarcation process, these coordinates are precisely established on-site using GPS or Total Station equipment, depending on site conditions.
Official demarcations often require the presence of government representatives or inspection authorities. At Royal Survey, we coordinate with these authorities and perform the survey in their presence to ensure transparency, accuracy, and compliance with legal requirements. Upon completion, we provide all necessary documentation and data to facilitate official approval of plot limits by the relevant authorities.
Gate Level Survey:
Gate Level Computation Surveys are conducted to determine the appropriate gate level of a plot in relation to nearby infrastructure—such as adjacent roads or neighboring plots. This elevation data is critical during the preconstruction phase. The survey is performed using Automatic Level Machines or GPS receivers connected to the Dubai Virtual Reference Station (DVRS), allowing quick and accurate access to geospatial data. Once the field data is collected, it is processed and analyzed in our office. The final gate level calculations are then submitted to the relevant authorities for review and approval. Gate level surveys are considered one of the most essential services in the early stages of development, find below the sample
 
 

Stakeout Survey:
A stakeout survey involves placing Steel/wooden stakes or other physical markers on the ground to indicate the exact locations of planned construction elements based on engineering or architectural plans. This critical step ensures that improvements are built in the correct location and to precise specifications.
Stakeouts are commonly performed for:
•	Building foundations
•	Structural columns
•	Pavement and roadways
•	Curbs and sidewalks
•	Underground utilities (e.g., water, sewer, electrical)
By translating design plans into physical ground markings, stakeout surveys help minimize construction errors and ensure alignment with project blueprints. They are essential for keeping construction on track and within tolerances.


Volumetric Survey:
A volumetric survey is a precise method used to measure the volume of stockpiles, earthworks, or other material accumulations. These surveys are essential for providing accurate, independent quantity assessments—commonly required in quarry operations, construction sites, and material stockpile management. At Royal Survey, our volumetric surveys deliver both qualitative and quantitative data tailored to your project needs. Results can be provided in CAD, PDF, and Excel formats, ensuring compatibility with your internal workflows and reporting standards.
Whether you need volume calculations for excavation, cut and fill analysis, or stockpile inventory control, our team ensures you get clear, reliable data every time.
